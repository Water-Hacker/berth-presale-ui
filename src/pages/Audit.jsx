            To our valued investors,
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            The security and integrity of the <span className="text-red-400 font-semibold">BERTH</span> project remain our highest priority. While a
            thorough third-party audit has been completed to ensure the reliability of our
            smart contracts, the full report is currently kept confidential.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This deliberate step is taken to prevent any potential exploitation or reverse
            engineering of contract logic before our official deployment. It's a common
            security measure for projects of this magnitude.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Once we officially deploy the platform, the <span className="text-red-400 font-semibold">full audit report</span> will be made public to ensure full transparency
            and confidence in our ecosystem.
          </p>

          <p className="text-gray-300 leading-relaxed">
            Thank you for your trust, patience, and unwavering support as we prepare for a
            secure and impactful launch.
